# StonePaperScissor-3.0_opencv
After creating two versions of Stone paper Scissor 

>* 1st -> Basic game where computer randomly chooses one and user have to give imput and player is decided.

>* 2nd -> New version where the computer decides it moves by listening to player's words (stone/ paper/ scissor)

### This time the player is not supposed to give user inputs, rather using computer vision, the player has to normally play using his/her hands(HandTracking).
